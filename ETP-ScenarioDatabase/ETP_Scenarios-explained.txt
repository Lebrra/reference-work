End of the Party - Scenarios Database

In this document I will be describing how I created a database to store randomly appearing events that dynamically function all within a handful of scenes.

-------------------------------------------

Data:

For storing the data of a scenario, I used Scriptable Objects because of the amount of variablity we wanted in our scenarios.
See Scenario.cs for the base scenario class or ScenarioExample.png for an example of one filled out in the Unity editor.

-------------------------------------------

Seed Generation:

GameDataManager.cs holds all the connections between the scriptable objects and the game in run-time. This manager can generate a new run seed, create a run using a given seed, or load a saved run using another script.
Each scenario is given a unique 3-digit index, with the first digit representing the scene index they are attached to. Each party member also has an id, represented as a single letter.
The seed builder method is very particular in how it builds its seeds; scenarios cannot be repeated, boat scenarios can only be started on, and not brought back to later, all character classes are unique.
The seed inputter is less picky, and allows for more custom play.

-------------------------------------------

Loading Scenarios:

Scenarios are loaded using the ScenarioLoader.cs script. Party Members are instantiated, UI is loaded, skills are updated for the battle phase, and Actions are prepared using the Scenario string names.
MethodsMasterList.cs (not included, see MethodsMasterList.png) converts strings into a Dictionary<string, Action> with a small amount of System.Reflection on load of the game.
Calling MethodsMasterList.masterList[methodName] returns the Action of the method in MethodsMasterList.cs, allowing any Scenario to alter any object in the game.

-------------------------------------------

That is the bulk of how my Scenario database works in End of the Party. Of course, there is a lot more going on than just that, so please check out the full game!
